git push origin master

Didn't work?
Check 'git status' to see if you missed anything.
It may also have asked you to pull my latest changes first

Ready to pull my changes?

'git pull' or 'git pull origin master'

Now you can push.

Want to work on your own branch?

'git branch' - lists all available branches (use 'git pull' to pull any new branches since last pull)

'git branch <NameOfYourBranch>' - creates branch with given name (a copy of the branch you are currently in)

'git checkout <NameOfYourBranch>' - switches to that branch

Or, in one short command, 'git checkout -b <NameOfYourBranch' to create and switch to the new branch

Want to merge the branch into master?

1st, in your branch, 'git pull origin master', to update to the master.
2nd, switch to master ('git checkout master')
3rd, merge in the changes ('git merge <NameOfYourBranch')
4th (optional), delete your branch, 'git branch -d <NameOfYourBranch>'
